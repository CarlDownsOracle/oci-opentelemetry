# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure OpenTelemetry Integration

---

## Overview

Let's take a look at bringing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)â€™s rich Logs resources OpenTelemetry-compatible
3rd systems.  This function sample shows how to perform simple JSON-to-JSON transformation of the OCI log and 
metric events to OpenTelemetry's API contract.  Transformed messages are then sent to an `OTEL Collector` using 
the `http` receiver as JSON.
